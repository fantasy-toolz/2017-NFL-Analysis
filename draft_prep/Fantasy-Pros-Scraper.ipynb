In a recent study I did, the Saints wide receivers have totaled 24 WR1 performances over the last three years, compared to 17 for the Patriots. He'll have WR1 weeks, but he'll be frustrating to own just like every other wide receiver drafted in his range. His upside is worth dealing with the frustrations. \n",

His 5.1 yards after contact was the best in the NFL last year, though the sample size was small. He is apparently dealing with a soft tissue injury, which is not ideal when you're fighting off three up-and-coming rookies who have been playing the position for a long time. Those types of injuries can also linger throughout the season, making Montgomery a risky pick at his current ADP. \n",

While he did lose Desean Jackson and Pierre Garcon, they attempted to right that by acquiring Terrelle Pryor. He'll also get last year's first-round pick Josh Doctson on the field, attempting to take over Garcon's role in the offense. It may take time to get acclimated, but Cousins is a back-end QB1. \n",

Carr turned heads with his 35.8 point performance against the Buccaneers last year, but in his other 14 games, Carr was very mediocre. He totaled just 16.6 points per game in all other games, which would have ranked 17th among quarterbacks last year. His schedule is among the worst in football and they just brought in Marshawn Lynch to steal some touchdowns. \n",

Matt Ryan's touchdown rate was north of 7 percent in 2016, which was almost double of what it's been in previous years. Gabriel saw 7 targets that were thrown 20 or more yards in the air, while the rest of the Falcons receivers saw 45 of those targets. Gabriel scored 3 touchdowns, which was equal to everyone else's combined. Regression is coming to a player who saw just under five targets per game with the Falcons. \n",
