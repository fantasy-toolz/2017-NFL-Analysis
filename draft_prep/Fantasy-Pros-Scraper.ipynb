Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram are going to see targets, potentially lowering Beckham's 169 target ceiling from last year.

The Broncos have added Carlos Henderson to the wide receiving corps, giving another playmaker who'll garner targets. Thomas is a solid third-round pick, though he lacks the upside I'm looking for.\n",

Hyde has broken 75 tackles over the last two years on just 370 touches and is one of the most elusive backs in the game. His 3.1 yards after contact last year ranked fifth among running backs with at least 100 carries.\n",

He's entering his age-34 season and he just came off a season where he saw 128 targets, yet finished as the No. 52 receiver. The last time someone saw more than 120 targets and finished outside the top 36 was 2014, where both Vincent Jackson and Andre Johnson accomplished that feat. They are both out of football at this point.\n",

Spencer Ware wore down as the season went on, but had been one of the strengths of their offense prior to the last few weeks in the 2016 season. Hunt is likely going to take over backup duties for Charcandrick West, but will have upside for much more. It might take a few weeks to reap the full benefits of owning him, though.  \n",

      "We were only able to see 47 touches for the rookie in 2016, but they were extremely impressive, netting 380 total yards and a touchdown. The concern is that the Seahawks brought in Eddie Lacy, as they were clearly unhappy with the health of their running backs last year. With the versatility that Prosise offers, it shouldn't shock anyone if he gets 10-12 touches out of the gate. If he can stay healthy, Pete Carroll will find ways to utilize him in the passing game. \n",

      "140.0 Jamaal Charles DEN  RB53\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, this may be the end for J.C. He hasn't really 'played' in a year-and-a-half, and when he did, he wasn't the same player. After attempting to return from his second torn ACL, Charles wound up having to get both of his knees cleaned out towards the end of last season. He's still not participating in OTA's, so it's very likely that Devontae Booker beats him out for the change-of-pace role behind C.J. Anderson. Even if he sticks, he'll likely max out at 8-10 touches per game. \n",
      "\n",
      "149.0 Latavius Murray MIN  RB51\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite finishing as the No. 13 running back in 2016, Murray wasn't very good, hence the reason the Raiders let him walk to sign a 31-year-old retired running back. Going from the Raiders offensive line that's ranked top-three in the NFL to the Vikings offensive line that ranks among the five worst was already a problem, but then he had foot surgery, and the Vikings traded up to draft Dalvin Cook in the second round. It's likely that Murray has seen his final days of fantasy relevance. \n",
      "\n",
      "164.0 Robby Anderson NYJ  WR57\n",
      "\n",
      "With Enunwa now out for the season, Anderson is expected to step up as the top receiving option for the Jets. While they will be playing most games from behind, the QB situation is not ideal so his upside is limited to a WR3.\n",
      "\n",
      "173.0 Carolina Panthers  DST8\n",
      "\n",
      "The Panthers plugged some holes in their secondary this off-season and will hopefully have a healthy Keuchley, which should play a major role in restoring them as a top 12 fantasy defense this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "188.0 Marlon Mack IND  RB60\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a high-upside pick towards the end of your draft, Mack fits the bill. He is lightning-in-a-bottle, while Frank Gore and Robert Turbin are more like a light drizzle at this point in time. If he gets the opportunity to start at any point in the season, you can pencil Mack in as an RB2, regardless of opponent. The offense is built for a player like him, and it's what they've been missing over the last few years, a running back who can make splash plays. \n",
