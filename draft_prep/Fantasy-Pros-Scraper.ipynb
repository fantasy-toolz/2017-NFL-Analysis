The offensive line is a problem, but it was also a problem in Green Bay, as the Packers running backs averaged a league-low 1.0 yards before contact in 2016. We're just looking for 15 touches per game from him at this point, but his stock is falling as Thomas Rawls has reportedly outplayed him in training camp. \n",

Once Diggs moved into the slot, Thielen started to do most of his damage, including his 202-yard, two touchdown performance in Week 16 against the Packers. He's still got a lot to prove, but 2016 was incredibly promising for the former undrafted free agent. \n",

      "It's been a roller coaster of an off-season for Stewart, as he had his contract extended, but then witnessed his team select two running backs with their first two picks. While Curtis Samuel isn't a traditional running back, he will get carries. And to spend a top-eight pick on a running back says a lot how they feel about their current situation. It's hard to see Stewart finish with more than 120 carries this season and he doesn't catch passes, so we're left with non-starter type numbers. \n",

Despite throwing 60 more passes in 2016, he finished with 438 fewer yards and nine fewer touchdowns. It didn't help that John Brown was injured for a majority of the season and that Michael Floyd turned bad. They added Chad Williams in the NFL Draft, but he's an extremely raw receiver. You should expect a slight increase on his 2016 totals, but don't expect him to return to 2015 form. \n",

Matt Ryan's touchdown rate was north of 7 percent in 2016, which was almost double of what it's been in previous years. Gabriel saw 7 targets that were thrown 20 or more yards in the air, while the rest of the Falcons receivers saw 45 of those targets. Gabriel scored 3 touchdowns, which was equal to everyone else's combined. Regression is coming to a player who saw just under five targets per game with the Falcons. \n",

Not that Wallace isn't solid, but he's not a No. 1, and Perriman hasn't shown anything to suggest he's ready for a full-time role. Look for Maclin and newly acquired running back Danny Woodhead to be favorites of Flacco. The Ravens have led the league in pass attempts over the last two years, but Flacco has just one game with more than 24 fantasy points in that span. He's a safe No. 2 quarterback in 2QB leagues, but not much more. \n",
