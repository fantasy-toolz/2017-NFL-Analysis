      "5.4 Julio Jones ATL  WR3\n",
      "\n",
      "Julio is #1 in NFL history with 96.3 yards per game. With that being said, he is an increased injury risk over Brown and Beckham, plus he has been known to dis\n",
      "\n",
      "20.3 Doug Baldwin SEA  WR11\n",
      "\n",
      "He's now finished as a top-10 wide receiver in back-to-back seasons, and that was despite Russell Wilson taking a slight step back last year, though it was likely injury-related. His target numbers have gone up four straight seasons, as have the Seahawks pass attempts. They are attempting to get their run-game going again, but Baldwin is who moves the sticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "34.6 Aaron Rodgers GB  QB1\n",
      "\n",
      "He's a machine, plain and simple. Year-over-year Rodgers builds his hall of fame resume, and it translates to fantasy, considering he's finished as the No. 1 or No. 2 quarterback in seven of nine seasons (was also No. 1 before getting hurt in 2013) since taking over for Brett Favre. There's so much uncertainty around this part of the rankings, he's simply a safer pick.\n",
      "\n",
      "45.4 Golden Tate DET  WR21\n",
      "\n",
      "After starting the year as a droppable fantasy asset, Tate totaled 943 yards and four touchdowns over the final 11 games in 2016, which was good enough to be the No. 10 wide receiver in that span. The Lions lost Anquan Boldin and replaced him with a late third-round rookie.\n",
      "\n",
      "55.4 Tyreek Hill KC  WR25\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand moving Hill up your list if you draft on upside alone, though I'm expecting massive regression with Hill. Not only did he score three special teams touchdowns, but he also scored nine rushing/receiving touchdowns on just 85 offensive touches (one every 9.4 touches). No receiver with more than 45 receptions scored a touchdown more than one every 10.1 targets in 2016, and that was Davante Adams who catches passes from Aaron Rodgers. Outside of Packers receivers, the next highest was Anquan Boldin at one every 11.9 targets. Hill is still catching passes from Alex Smith the last I checked, so I'm not betting on his crazy touchdown per touch ratio happening again.\n",
      "\n",
      "69.4 Kelvin Benjamin CAR  WR32\n",
      "\n",
      "He's finished inside the top-20 wide receivers in both seasons he's played, but it's hard to feel confident in him, knowing that he's had weight issues for the second-straight off-season. The additions of Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel will likely eat up some of the shorter targets that used to go to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "80.7 Marcus Mariota TEN  QB8\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard not to take notice as to what the Titans have done this off-season, precisely in their attempts to get Mariota more weapons. Not only did they draft Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor, they also went out and signed Eric Decker to a one-year contract. If Mariota disappoints, it won't be because of the talent around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "93.2 Tyrell Williams LAC  WR41\n",
      "\n",
      "Just one year after finishing as the No. 13 wide receiver, there are plenty of question marks surrounding Williams. Not only is Keenan Allen returning from injury, but the Chargers surprised everyone by drafting Mike Williams with the No. 7 pick in the draft. Competition for targets is the key here, and by the Chargers actions, they'll be hard to come by for last year's breakout receiver. He still offers plenty of upside later in drafts. \n",
      "\n",
      "102.6 Dak Prescott DAL  QB13\n",
      "\n",
      "Was the No. 6 quarterback last year on a points per game basis if you were to remove Week 17 when he was pulled after one series. There were only four quarterbacks who were QB1's in 68.8 percent of their games last year: Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, Aaron Rodgers, and Prescott (that includes his Week 17 game). My biggest concern is his schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "114.7 C.J. Prosise SEA  RB42\n",
      "\n",
      "We were only able to see 47 touches for the rookie in 2016, but they were extremely impressive, netting 380 total yards and a touchdown. The concern is that the Seahawks brought in Eddie Lacy, as they were clearly unhappy with the health of their running backs last year. With the versatility that Prosise offers, it shouldn't shock anyone if he gets 10-12 touches out of the gate. If he can stay healthy, Pete Carroll will find ways to utilize him in the passing game. \n",
      "\n",
      "127.6 Corey Davis TEN  WR50\n",
      "\n",
      "He's an amazing talent and one that should be a force in the league for years to come, but it's a rare scenario in which a rookie comes in at wide receiver to dominate right away. Settling him in the WR3 range is the most likely of scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "145.7 Sterling Shepard NYG  WR53\n",
      "\n",
      "There were 41 players who saw at least 100 targets in 2016, and just four scored more touchdowns on a per-target basis: Davante Adams, Jordy Nelson, Rishard Matthews, and Antonio Brown. Not too bad for a rookie, right? The additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram cloud his outlook, but he just might surprise people who take a chance on him later in drafts. \n",
