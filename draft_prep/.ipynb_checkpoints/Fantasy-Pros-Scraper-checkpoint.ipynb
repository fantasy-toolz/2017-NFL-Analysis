He's averaged 1,579 yards and 10.8 touchdowns in that span, and keep in mind that he posted his two best seasons while Martavis Bryant was on the field with him.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cooks was the #8 receiver in football last season with Drew Brees, and while the Patriots do have more weapons to spread the ball around to, they still have Tom Brady so Cooks should once again be a WR1.\n",

      "\n",
      "What do you get when you mix an average running back with a great offensive line? An RB2, that's Crowell in a nutshell. Most point to his yards per carry (4.8) being great last year, but he totaled 48 percent of his rushing yards on just 16 carries. Their offensive line may just be the best in the NFL at this point, making him an intriguing option.\n",
      "\n",
      "47.4 Larry Fitzgerald ARI  WR22\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering what is likely his last NFL season, Fitzgerald has now put up back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons with Carson Palmer behind center. They added Chad Williams via the draft, but he needs time to develop. The only competition he has for targets over the middle of the field is David Johnson. Fitzgerald was also sixth in redzone targets last year with 23 of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "53.5 Jarvis Landry MIA  WR24\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely lower than most, I'm expecting Devante Parker to take a step forward in 2017. After averaging nine targets per game over the first 36 games of his career, Landry averaged just 7.1 targets over the final 12 games under Adam Gase. He's somewhat safe in PPR leagues, but there's not a whole lot of upside here.\n",

      "72.7 Mike Gillislee NE  RB28\n",
      "\n",
      "The Patriots ran the ball more often inside the 5-yard line than any other team in the NFL and it wasn't even close. Blount was among the worst RBs in terms of yards per carry, Gillislee was the single best. Gillislee has also been the best at converting goal line carries over the past two seasons. He could be in for a huge season if Belichek puts the ball in his hands enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "77.7 Kyle Rudolph MIN  TE7\n",
      "\n",
      "People left the bandwagon too early on him, myself included. But when you see the chemistry between him and Sam Bradford, you should be buying in. He saw a position-high 132 targets last year, including 8.7 per game once offensive coordinator Pat Shurmer took over. Keep in mind that he finished as the No. 3 tight end, while both Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs got theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "94.7 Eddie Lacy SEA  RB33\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a lot to worry about with Lacy: the Seahawks offensive line is the worst in the league, Lacy has weight issues and CJ Prosise is just one of several backs vying for touches behind him. What it all comes down to, however, is that Lacy is among the most talented \n",
      "\n",
      "99.7 Robert Kelley WAS  RB36\n",
      "\n",
      "Most remember Kelley for his Monday night performance against the Packers in Week 11 where he finished with 137 yards and three touchdowns, but they must've missed what ensued after that game. In the final six games of the season, Kelley averaged just 3.33 yards per carry on 84 carries with two touchdowns. He averaged just 8.05 fantasy points per game in that stretch, leading the Redskins to go out and snag Samaje Perine in the NFL Draft. You shouldn't bet on him to retain the starting job for very long, as he can only contribute on first and second down, making the offense predictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "116.5 Andy Dalton CIN  QB16\n",
      "\n",
      "Most don't know that Dalton has finished as a top-12 fantasy quarterback in three of the last five years, including a No. 4 finish in 2013. He's got some issues on the offensive line, but he also has the best receiving options he's ever had, and it's really not all that close. \n",
      "\n",
      "125.6 Tyrod Taylor BUF  QB18\n",
      "\n",
      "Finished as the QB7 on a point per game basis in 2016, and was after finishing as the QB8 in 2015. He continues to be one of the most under-appreciated players in all of fantasy. The Bills went out and spent a high-2nd-round pick in order to snag wide receiver Zay Jones, signed free agent Anquan Boldin, and traded for Jordan Matthews. This is all negated, of course, by the fact that they traded away his true No. 1 wide receiver in Sammy Watkins. Taylor has only averaged one fewer fantasy point per game without Watkins playing, though it's not the largest of sample sizes. Losing Watkins really hurts. \n",
