In a recent study I did, the Saints wide receivers have totaled 24 WR1 performances over the last three years, compared to 17 for the Patriots. He'll have WR1 weeks, but he'll be frustrating to own just like every other wide receiver drafted in his range. His upside is worth dealing with the frustrations. \n",

In the final six games of the season, Kelley averaged just 3.33 yards per carry on 84 carries with two touchdowns. He averaged just 8.05 fantasy points per game in that stretch, leading the Redskins to go out and snag Samaje Perine in the NFL Draft. You shouldn't bet on him to retain the starting job for very long, as he can only contribute on first and second down, making the offense predictable.\n",
