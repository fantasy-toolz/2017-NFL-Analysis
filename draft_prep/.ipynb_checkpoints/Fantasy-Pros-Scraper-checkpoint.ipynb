No receiver with more than 45 receptions scored a touchdown more than one every 10.1 targets in 2016, and that was Davante Adams who catches passes from Aaron Rodgers. Outside of Packers receivers, the next highest was Anquan Boldin at one every 11.9 targets.

The last time someone saw more than 120 targets and finished outside the top 36 was 2014, where both Vincent Jackson and Andre Johnson accomplished that feat.

Carr turned heads with his 35.8 point performance against the Buccaneers last year, but in his other 14 games, Carr was very mediocre. He totaled just 16.6 points per game in all other games, which would have ranked 17th among quarterbacks last year. His schedule is among the worst in football and they just brought in Marshawn Lynch to steal some touchdowns. \n",

The Patriots extended him this off-season and paid him more than any other running back on the roster. He was the only player who finished in the top-36 last year without seeing at least 110 touches. If his role grows, as we expect it to, White should be in the running to finish as an RB2 in PPR leagues and a solid RB3 in standard leagues. \n",

The Bills went out and spent a high-2nd-round pick in order to snag wide receiver Zay Jones, signed free agent Anquan Boldin, and traded for Jordan Matthews. This is all negated, of course, by the fact that they traded away his true No. 1 wide receiver in Sammy Watkins. Taylor has only averaged one fewer fantasy point per game without Watkins playing, though it's not the largest of sample sizes. Losing Watkins really hurts. \n",

Lee was actually drafted before Robinson in 2014 but hasn't been able to stay healthy, missing 9 games in his first two years. There may be something here, and if you think there is, you'll need to move Allen Robinson down your list. \n",
