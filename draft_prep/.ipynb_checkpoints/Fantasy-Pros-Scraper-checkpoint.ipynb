      "5.0 Odell Beckham Jr. NYG  WR2\n",
      "\n",
      "You're nit-picking when trying to decipher between Beckham, Jones, and Brown, but the area of concern for Beckham is his newfound competition for targets. Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram are going to see targets, potentially lowering Beckham's 169 target ceiling from last year. He's talented enough to make up for the decrease, but still a tick below Jones and Brown for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "20.0 Todd Gurley LAR  RB9\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rams added Andrew Whitworth and Sammy Watkins which should help Gurley a ton, but there is still the fact that Jared Goff is his QB, so he may still see some stacked boxes. He still has the ceiling of a top 5 player and will get enough carries that he has a high floor too.\n",
      "\n",
      "29.0 Christian McCaffrey CAR  RB16\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonathan Stewart is still looming, so don't look past it, but McCaffrey is the better talent and even if he doesn't get the lions share of the carries, he may be the best receiver in the draft class. There are so many ways for the rookie to pile up the points that it will happen one way or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "44.0 Carlos Hyde SF  RB15\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't buy the Joe Williams hype, even if he was hand-picked by the new regime. So was Tevin Coleman, but Devonta Freeman was the better player who got the bulk of the work. Hyde has broken 75 tackles over the last two years on just 370 touches and is one of the most elusive backs in the game. His 3.1 yards after contact last year ranked fifth among running backs with at least 100 carries.\n",
      "\n",
      "53.0 Martavis Bryant PIT  WR27\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't sleep on how good Bryant was when on the field, as eight of his 21 career games have netted 14 or more standard fantasy points, including four of them with 20 or more. The Steelers just cut Ladarius Green, freeing up even more targets than initially thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "68.0 Tevin Coleman ATL  RB25\n",
      "\n",
      "Still feels too high for a backup running back who just lost one of the best offensive coordinators in football, but he does offer splash potential. Had just two games with more than 58 rushing yards in 2016, and touchdowns regression is all but certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "77.0 Frank Gore IND  RB28\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't know how long he'll hold onto the job, seeing as he has averaged just 3.8 yards per carry since coming to the Colts. He's also scored just 10 touchdowns on the ground, leading them to use Robert Turbin in goal-line situations last year. They also drafted Marlon Mack, who could supplant Gore at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "92.0 DeSean Jackson TB  WR36\n",
      "\n",
      "He'll be drafted much higher than this, but Jackson is going to find it tough to crack the top-30 with Mike Evans on the other side of the field. This was a better real-life football signing than it was for fantasy purposes. He'll turn 31-years-old at the end of the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "101.0 Terrance West BAL  RB32\n",
      "\n",
      "With the news of Dixon being out for the year, West skyrockets up draft boards. There is always the chance that the Ravens would be unsatisfied with West as a starter and go acquire a better back, but until then, West must be drafted in the top 40 based on expected touches alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "116.0 Jordan Matthews BUF  WR44\n",
      "\n",
      "With Sammy Watkins out of Buffalo and Matthews in as presumably the team's #1 receiver, Matthews ceiling bumps to a low-end WR2. The Bills will be bad enough this season that they should have plenty of positive game scripts for the passing game.\n",
      "\n",
      "125.0 Jack Doyle IND  TE13\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite playing alongside Dwayne Allen and with a less-than-100-percent Andrew Luck, Doyle was able to finish as the No. 13 tight end last year, yet his ADP is currently in the 13th round as the 16th tight end off the board. If Doyle isn't in your top-12 tight ends, you should be expecting big things from Erik Swoope.\n",
      "\n",
      "140.0 Zay Jones BUF  WR54\n",
      "\n",
      "With the recent signing of Anquan Boldin and the acquisition of Sammy Watkins, the Bills are telling us Zay might not quite be ready. He was tremendous in college as a possession receiver, and if given snaps, could be an impact rookie. He is a lottery ticket at this point.\n",
